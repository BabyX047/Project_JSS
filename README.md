This project in a nutshell, seek to solve a niche in ICT integration in Kenya's primary school.
This niche is brought about by the heavy reliance on ICT integration brought about by the new CBC curriculum. Despite the reliance on ICT integration, there has not been effort to keep teachers up to date in their skill gaps.
That is the problem I seek to solve.
